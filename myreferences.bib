  abstract     = {Abstract-Sports video analysis tools are gaining enormous popularity
as they enable enhanced visualization and analysis of the
game. An intriguing problem is localizing and tracking the ball in
a game of tennis. However, achieving a practically suitable tradeoff
between high detection accuracy and speed of the ball is a
challenging problem in automatic ball tracking algorithms. In this
paper, we propose a machine learning based automated ball tracking
algorithm in tennis match videos acquired by a camera mounted on a
quadcopter. We begin with applying a video stabilization technique
followed by random forest segmentation for detecting tennis ball
candidates in the video frames. The yellow color plane intensity and
Phase Quaternion Fourier Transform (PQFT) saliency are used as
features for random forest segmentation. The effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm is demonstrated on datasets from real-world
tennis videos. The experimental results show that our algorithm is
robust and achieves 94 % accuracy in best case and successfully
detects the ball even in cases of partial occlusion by net or racket.},
